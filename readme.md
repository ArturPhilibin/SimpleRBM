A Simple implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep Belief Network

## About

A Restricted Boltzmann machine is a type artificial neural network that is gaining a lot of popularity.  They are used in everything from feature generation to image processing to simulating creativity.

A deep belief network is a series of Restricted Boltzmann Machines stacked on top of each other; the output of one is the input to the next.

This is a distilled version of a tool I use for generating features.  It's written primarily for ease of understanding.
